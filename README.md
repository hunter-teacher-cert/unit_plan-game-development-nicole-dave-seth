### General Overview
#### DESCRIPTION:
* Students will complete a unit on Game Development from the ideation stage until the final product
#### POSSIBLE COURSES:
* Any CS course: can fit well into intro to CS or APCSP (block based for accesibility to non-coders)
#### PLACEMENT IN COURSE SEQUENCE:
* Ideally after some basic coding so students know basic conditionals and looping.  This way they can get into the game coding and design verse needing to learn a lot of the coding.
* Learn History of Gaming and CS -> Learn Game Design Principals and Concepts -> Design and Program Game -> Connect Game to Social Issue -> Demo Game and Implement Feedback

---

### Motivation for Unit
* This fits very well into almost any programing class
* The students can go from history of CS to modern gaming and how gaming has been a huge driving factor in CS inovation
* Students will be able to assess accesibility by starting a game for the Games for Change student challenge
* Gets at basic design thinking that can motivate students to engage deeply in programing
